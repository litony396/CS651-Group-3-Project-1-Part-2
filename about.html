			We, the founders of KREMO, have loved ice cream all our lives and have worked in various ice cream jobs. We have held many jobs at various ice cream shops around the East Bay area until we decided to start running our own ice cream delivery truck. After 5 years in the ice cream delivery business, we decided to innovate by integrating self-driving technology into our business in order to help deliver even more ice cream to your mouths!

			We decided to implement LIDAR technology to our ice cream truck in order to automate our ice cream delivery patrol routes. KREMO trucks have set patrols which go through the neighborhoods which we cover. From our trucks you can order various ice cream flavors just like a normal ice cream truck through an AI ice cream salesmen by voice or through a kiosk attached to the truck. We also have additional features on top of the normal ice cream truck patrols. Through the KREMO app, you can even order ice cream delivery straight to your door. You have access to our many different flavors and variants of ice cream, ready for you within 15 minutes of ordering. We cover many neighborhoods of the East Bay area so be on the lookout or contact us to know if we patrol your neighborhood!
